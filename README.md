CodeAppKit

This is my first app creator.
Pretend this is Visual Studio, except, it's only BatchCode.
There is a limit on coding.
Every update, the limit gets higher.
When you type the app name, make sure, that at the end, there is ".bat".
I got inspired by Berry, and his own game maker BerryEngine.

How it works?
Every coding line applies to the program.
The lines are saving inside the CodeAppKit.
After that, all the lines are getting converted.
Each line has a name.
They have a name, because without name, they aren't convertable.
The convert works through a PowerShell system that is saved to CMD.

The program is saved, and ready to go.
